# **eMooring** #

A [mooring ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooring_(watercraft))refers to any permanent structure to which a vessel may be secured. eMooring modernizes the operation of marinas with the installation of a wireless sensor network to monitor mooring berths, measuring the sea water level and observing the weather conditions.

The marinas administrators have a clear view of the status of the berths, improving this way the quality of the services and the scheduling of the yachting trips
